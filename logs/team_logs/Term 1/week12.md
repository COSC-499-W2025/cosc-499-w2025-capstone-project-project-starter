## Overview

### Milestone Goals

- 6. Store user configurations for future use
- 9. Extrapolate individual contributions for a given collaboration project
- 10. Extract key contribution metrics in a project, displaying information about the duration of the project and activity type contribution frequency (e.g., code vs test vs design vs document), and other important information
- 11. Output all the key information for a project
- 13. Retrieve previously generated portfolio information
- 14. Retrieve previously generated résumé item
- 15. Rank importance of each project based on user's contributions
- 16. Summarize the top ranked projects
- 17. Delete previously generated insights and ensure files that are shared across multiple reports do not get affected
- 18. Produce a chronological list of projects
- 19. Produce a chronological list of skills exercised
