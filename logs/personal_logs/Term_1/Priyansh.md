### Recap

This week marked our team transitioned from planning to active development. My primary focus was on creating the team log for Week 7 and reviewing pull requests to ensure code quality and documentation completeness.

I took responsibility for writing the comprehensive team log for Week 7, documenting active development. The log covered the successful merge of 6 pull requests, including our first code implementation (PR #27 - Analyzer, Report, and Statistics classes), the closure of 2 issues, and the creation of 7 new GitHub issues to organize parallel development work.

Additionally, I reviewed and approved PR #44 (Enhanced Documentation for Class Structure). This was a critical PR that added a 100-line README explaining the entire class architecture and how Statistics, Reports, and Analyzers work together. I verified that all 15 test cases were passing and confirmed that the code examples clearly demonstrated how to use the statistics system. I also reviewed the new PR template that was added to standardize future contributions, ensuring it will help the whole team work more efficiently with the codebase as we continue development.


## Week 8, Oct. 20-26

### Peer Eval
![Peer Eval](../../../logs/log_images/personal_log_imgs/Term_1/priyansh/priyansh_week8_log.png)

### Recap

This week's goal was to implement critical features for our end-to-end workflow and extend code analysis capabilities.

I completed Issue #67, implementing project discovery from zip files with Git-based group detection—a core feature enabling our workflow to start from user uploads. This included creating 6 comprehensive tests covering multiple projects, Mac zip structures, and Git authorship analysis. I also implemented Issue #90, creating JavaAnalyzer and JavaScriptAnalyzer classes using regex-based parsing to extend analysis beyond Python. Both analyzers count classes, functions, and imports, with full test coverage including test fixtures (example_java.java, example_javascript.js).

Additionally, I reviewed PR #87 GitHub Pytest Action by Sam, which adds CI/CD to automatically run tests on every PR. I also reviewed PR #91 on user-readable UserReport formatting by Tawana, providing feedback on test coverage and code consistency.

## Week 9, Oct. 27-Nov. 2

### Peer Eval
![Peer Eval](../../../logs/log_images/personal_log_imgs/Term_1/priyansh/priyansh_week9_log.png)

### Recap
This week, our team aimed to strengthen the platform’s core by expanding multi-language code analysis, improve reporting, enhancing resume file handling, and refining database flexibility.

I completed Issue #130 by implementing project-level aggregate statistics in ProjectReport. This feature aggregates statistics across all files in a project, allowing users to view comprehensive metrics such as total lines of code, number of classes, and functions at the project level. The implementation required updating the ProjectReport class, integrating aggregation logic, and ensuring compatibility with existing reporting workflows.

I also created the C and TypeScript analyzer PR which completes Issue #122, which extends our code analysis capabilities to new languages. The new analyzers use regex-based parsing to count classes, functions, and imports in C and TypeScript files, mirroring the approach used for Java and JavaScript. This update improves the flexibility of our statistics system and supports more diverse codebases. I wrote and validated tests for these analyzers to ensure accurate results and robust integration.

Both PRs are foundational for expanding our platform's functionality and data aggregation. Additionally, I reviewed three PRs: 'changes for dynamic column generation' by Alex, 'Created Very Basic Resume Class Structure' by Sam, and '142: CSS HTML PHP analyzers by Tawana'. My feedback focused on code correctness, maintainability, and alignment with project goals.

## Week 10, Nov. 3-9

### Recap
The team’s efforts this week focused on improving platform portability, database organization, and documentation completeness, setting a strong foundation for the next phase of development.

I completed Issue #125 by implementing robust OS detection logic in the codebase. This allows the platform to accurately determine the host operating system in both dev containers and end-user environments, enabling the correct extraction command for Windows, macOS, and Linux. I added and validated new tests for host OS detection to ensure reliability.

I also completed Issue #59 by adding comprehensive support for extracting .zip, .tar.gz, .gz, and .7z files. The extraction logic now uses system tools when available and Python libraries as a fallback, ensuring reliable multi-format extraction on all platforms. I updated and expanded tests to verify extraction for each format.

Additionally, I reviewed and approved three PRs: PR #167 (database documentation) by Alex, Tawana's personal log PR #180, and Jimi's personal log PR #182. I also created the comprehensive team log for Week 10.

## Week 12, Nov. 17-23

### Recap
This week's focus was on enhancing user experience, database functionality, resume generation, and project analysis capabilities to support more robust portfolio management.

I completed PR #274 (233 add cli prompt for naming user reports and listing by title). This PR adds a prompt to name your portfolio after it's created (or keep the zip name), remembers that title, and adds a menu option to retrieve portfolios by listing them, typing a name, or loading the last one you analyzed. The implementation includes comprehensive tests and closes issues #233 and #228. This feature significantly improves the user experience when managing multiple reports by providing flexible naming and retrieval options.

I reviewed numerous PRs this week including PR #272 (dynamically generate resume and portfolio header lengths) by Alex, PR #271 (Add prompt to cover user permissions for third-party Git features) by Jimi, PR #260 (216 b create cli menu option to delete a user report) by Erem, PR #254 (created function to get UserReport from database) by Alex, PR #273 (Rework Resume Class Structure, Refactor ResumeBuilder) by Sam, PR #264 (Project-Level Activity Type Contribution Attributes) by Sam.
