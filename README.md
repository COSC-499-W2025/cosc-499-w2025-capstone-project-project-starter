- **The project** aims to quantify the volume of work individuals have completed and provide insightful metrics to summarize their contributions concisely and discreetly. By connecting to data sources (like GitHub or local files) and using a Docker SQL database, the system allows for deep data collection and analysis to customize graphs and metrics based on what stands out most for each user.
- **Primary Group**: Graduating students and early-career professionals who regularly create digital work artifacts on their computers.
- **Secondary Group**: Career counselors and academic advisors who guide students in using these insights to articulate professional growth.
- **Other Stakeholders**: Employees and managers who can use the system to track and verify work contributions.

## **System Architecture**

This layered architecture diagram provides a high-level view of how the system interacts across components and data flows.

### **Architecture Overview**

The architecture is organized into **four primary layers**, each with a specific responsibility:

**Presentation Layer**
   – user facing interfaces for interaction and output 
   - Display project summaries, metrics, and skill visualizations
   - Support future React-based Web Dashboard
     
**Application Layer** 
  – core business logic for analysis and decision-making  
  - Parse and validate ZIP files
  - Route analysis tasks (local vs external)
    
**Data / Integration Layer**
  – mediates between logic and storage or external APIs
  - Handle optional connections to external LLMs or APIs (if user allows)
  - Extract file metadata (name, type, size, structure)
    
**Database Layer**
  – persistent storage for structured data and metadata
  - Provides durable, structured storage for all collected and analyzed data.
  - Support data retrieval for résumé and portfolio generation

## **DFD level 1**
<img width="643" height="924" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dea9944-18a2-4b55-9224-f82c0c6db18e" />

### **Overview**
This DFD represents the **data movement and processing** inside the system when a user uploads, analyzes, and retrieves work artifacts.  
It highlights the main external entities, processes, and data stores involved in the workflow.

---

#### 1. **External Entities**
- **Early Professionals / Students**  
  The main users of the system who provide login credentials and initiate artifact scanning.  
  They want to analyze their work output and generate summarized portfolios.

- **HR Representative**  
  Acts as a facilitator or stakeholder who can provide **user details** or verify data sources (for professional data mining).

- **Data Source**  
  Represents external systems, repositories, or local folders containing digital work artifacts — such as documents, code, media, or design files.

---

#### 2. **Core Process: Mining Digital Work Artifacts**
This is the **main system** responsible for analyzing digital files.

**Inputs:**
- User details (from HR or direct login)
- Extracted raw data (from data sources)

**Processes:**
- Scans and parses the digital artifacts
- Extracts metadata (file type, timestamps, contributions)
- Performs content and activity analysis
- Summarizes insights (skills, project duration, contributions, etc.)

**Outputs:**
- Result data ready for visualization and portfolio storage

---

#### 3. **Supporting Processes**

- **Digital Artifacts System**  
  The entry point where user operations (like “Scan Artifacts”) are initiated.  
  It requires login credentials and sends **user detail** information downstream.

- **HR Representative**  
  Validates user identity and provides additional metadata (if applicable).

- **Data Source**  
  Supplies **raw digital artifacts** for analysis. It interacts with the system by sending **data extraction results** to the Mining system.

---

#### 4. **Downstream Systems**

- **Portfolio Store System**  
  After analysis, results (such as summary reports or extracted skills) are sent here for **storage and visualization**.  
  It converts processed results into structured **portfolio data**.

- **Portfolio Database**  
  The storage backend where all summarized user portfolios and extracted data insights are kept for retrieval.
