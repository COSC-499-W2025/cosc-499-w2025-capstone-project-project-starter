# Capstone Analyzer (Python)

Local, consent-aware archive analysis implemented entirely in Python – no Electron dependencies required. Use the `capstone` CLI to manage consent preferences and to extract metadata, collaboration insights, languages, frameworks, and timeline metrics from zipped projects.

## Quickstart

```bash
# (Optional) create and activate a virtual environment before running commands
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Record consent for analysis
capstone consent grant

# Analyse an archive (results saved to analysis_output/ by default)
capstone analyze /path/to/project.zip

# Request external processing explicitly (default mode is local)
capstone analyze /path/to/project.zip --analysis-mode external

# Stream the summary JSON to the terminal
capstone analyze /path/to/project.zip --summary-to-stdout

# Inspect or reset stored preferences/consent
capstone config show
capstone config reset

# Run the Python unit test suite (config, consent, CLI, metrics, etc.)
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```

Key features:
- Encrypted local configuration that stores consent decisions, analysis preferences, and last-opened folders.
- Consent workflow that blocks analysis until users explicitly grant permission.
- JSONL metadata with per-file language classification and activity type (code, documentation, asset, other).
- Collaboration labelling (individual vs collaborative) driven by Git log evidence found within the archive.
- Automatic fallback to local analysis whenever external processing is unavailable or not approved.
- Rich summary including language counts, framework detection (from `requirements.txt`/`package.json`), activity timeline, and scan duration.
- Entire test suite is Python-based; use `python -m unittest ...` rather than `npm test`.
- Additional helpers replicate legacy Electron behaviours: config reset/validation, interactive consent prompting, markdown detection for Node/Electron apps, and skill confidence scoring.
- Git collaboration analysis now parses `git log --numstat` output, filters bots/shared accounts, weights commits/reviews/line changes, and stores JSON snapshots in a local SQLite db for future dashboards.

# Work Breakdown Structure
[Link to WBS](docs/Plan/wbs.md)
# Milestone #1
The focus of this milestone is to create the functionality for parsing and outputting information correctly. We will be very particular about your system design and testing approach during this phase. All the output for this milestone is expected to be in text (that is, you can opt for a CSV, JSON, plain text output, etc., or a combination that facilitates your future development). The specific requirements are below.
The system must be able to ... :

## 1.0 User Interaction and Consent Module
  - 1.1 Data Access Consent
      - 1.1.1 Display user consent dialog before data access
      - 1.1.2 Record and store consent decision
      - 1.1.3 Block operations for users who have not granted consent
  - 1.2 External Service Permission
      - 1.2.1 Request explicit permission to use external LLM or APIs
      - 1.2.2 Display privacy implications and data usage details
      - 1.2.3 Implement fallback (local) analysis if external service is not approved

## 2.0 Parse a specified zipped folder containing nested folders and files
  - 2.1 Verify the .zip extension
  - 2.2 Iterate through nested folders inside the zip
  - 2.3 For each file: extract path, size, modified time
  - 2.4 Build artifact records with unique IDs
  - 2.5 Store parsed metadata as JSON lines
  - 2.6 Generate summary: number of files, total bytes, scan duration

## 3.0 Return an error if the specified file is in the wrong format
  - 3.1 Detect non-zip inputs (e.g .pdf, .jpg .exe)
  - 3.2 Define standard error schema: { "error": "InvalidInput", "detail": "..."}
  - 3.3 Store the error logs

## 4.0 Request User Permission Before Using External Services
  - 4.1 Current Status
      - At this stage of the project (Milestone #1), the system does not use any online tools or AI models (like LLMs). All analysis happens locally on the user’s computer. However, this module prepares the system for future milestones where online or AI-based features might be added (for example, a cloud analysis tool or an AI summary generator).
  - 4.2 Consent and Transparency
      - Whenever external processing is introduced in the future, the system will:
          - Display a clear consent message before any data is shared.
      - Inform the user about:
          - What data will be sent (e.g., text or metadata).
          - Why it is being sent (e.g., for generating summaries or analytics).
          - Where it is going (e.g., a trusted API).
          - How privacy and data storage are handled.
          - Offer options to Allow Once, Always Allow, or Deny, and remember the user’s choice.
          - Record each response with a date, time, and user ID for transparency.
          - Block any external request if permission is denied.
  - 4.3 Expected Outcome
      - Users clearly understand any future privacy implications and will always have control over their data.
      - During this milestone, no data leaves the computer, and the system remains fully local and privacy-safe.

## 5.0 Have Alternative Analyses in Place If Sending Data to an External Service Is Not Permitted
  - 5.1 Purpose
      - Ensure the software continues to function completely even when users do not allow online processing or when the computer is offline.
  - 5.2 Implementation Plan
      - Provide offline (local) analysis options for all major features, such as detecting programming languages, skills, and user contributions.
      - Only disable optional online tools (for example, AI summaries) if permission is denied.
      - Keep the same output style (JSON, CSV, or text) for both online and offline modes.
      - Display a small “Local Analysis Mode” label so users know their data is being processed only on their computer.
      - Test both local and online modes to confirm that results remain consistent.
  - 5.3 Expected Outcome
      - The system stays fully operational, accurate, and privacy-friendly even without internet access or user consent for external processing.

## 6.0 Store User Configurations for Future Use
  - 6.1 Purpose
      - Save each user’s settings and preferences so they do not have to reset everything every time they open the program.
  - 6.2 Implementation Plan
      - Store preferences such as last opened folder, analysis mode, and theme in a small configuration file or database table.
      - Include the user’s consent choice in these saved settings.
      - Protect private details through basic encryption.
      - Automatically load saved settings when the program starts.
      - Provide a “Reset Settings” button to restore default values.
      - Update saved settings whenever the user changes preferences.
  - 6.3 Expected Outcome
      - User configurations are remembered across sessions, creating a smooth, consistent, and personalized experience each time the software is used.

## 7.0 Distinguish Individual Projects from Collaborative Projects
  - 7.1 Purpose
      - Identify whether a project was completed by one person or by a team, so that contribution reports and rankings are fair and accurate.
  - 7.2 Implementation Plan
      - Review project information and Git commit logs to find how many contributors worked on each project.
      - Classify projects as:
          - Individual – one author only.
          - Collaborative – multiple contributors.
      - Measure the main user’s contribution level (e.g., number of commits or lines of code).
      - Exclude automated accounts or bots from the contributor count.
      - Show this information in project summaries, dashboards, and ranking lists.
  - 7.3 Expected Outcome
      - Each project is correctly labeled as individual or collaborative.
      - This allows fair evaluation of personal work and teamwork in reports and summaries.

# DFD Level 1
https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-17-1/blob/docs-finalization/docs/design/dfd.md

The Level 1 DFD outlines how user-selected sources are processed to extract, analyze, and visualize digital artifacts.The process begins when a User selects sources, triggering the upload module to scan and detect files. These are processed by identifying file types, eliminating corrupt files, and extracting information. During this stage, the system will record an error log for any unreadable or corrupted files in the logs database for troubleshooting.

Processed files are categorized and metrics are derived. These metrics are saved in the database and then passed to the visualization module to create dashboard/portfolio reports for the user.

Additionally, users are able to search, filter, and save generated portfolios in the database. This allows them to retrieve/export for external use whenever they desire. All actions are tracked through logs. The data flow concludes with the final outputs returned to the user, completeing a clear and transparent user-controlled cycle.

The document proposes a local first app that mines a user’s own files to help them understand and showcase their work history. It targets students and early professionals who want clear timelines, trends, and portfolio style summaries without sending data off the device. In scope are scanning chosen folders, classifying common file types, deduplicating with strong hashes, storing results in a local data store, and presenting dashboards plus simple exports. Users control what is scanned, can pause or resume, and see transparent previews and progress with errors surfaced. Typical use cases include presentations, reviews, resumes, and quick retrospectives.

Functionally, the system lets a user pick sources, crawls and classifies artifacts, builds searchable indexes and filters by time, type, project, and path, and produces insights like activity timelines and type distributions. Non functional goals stress fast setup, efficient and resumable scans, responsiveness, accessibility, and strong privacy and security. Data stays local with least privilege, encrypted storage using the operating system keystore, a localhost only API with per session tokens, secure deletion, and redaction of sensitive patterns in cached snippets. Maintainability expectations include straightforward developer setup, high automated test coverage, pinned dependencies, signed releases, and clear documentation.

For an initial milestone, the team should ship source selection, common type detection, hashing into SQLite with indexes, a live progress bar with pause and resume, basic dashboards for timeline and type distribution, search and filters, delete from index, a minimal local API, and CSV or JSON export with a preview. Success looks like accurate classification for most common types, a medium scan that completes within minutes on a typical laptop, common interactions that respond within a couple of seconds, and users reporting that the visualizations improve their understanding of their work. Key risks are privacy leaks, interruptions, and performance slowdowns, addressed by on device processing with redaction, checkpoint and resume, and resource caps with a light scan mode.

## Team Contract
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lw_CeWKMtIAGRbn4z4xmESP87En25rSU8GsUcTXPijQ/edit?usp=sharing
## Vision and Goals

We strive to be a team that is respectful, reliable, and supportive.
Our goals include:
1. Deliver a high quality project that meets the course requirements and the needs of our client.
2. Help each other learn new skills and grow throughout the term.
3. Communicate early and openly so that problems are handled effectively.
4. Share responsibilities in a way that is balanced and transparent.

## Expectations

### Meetings

- **Punctuality and General Attendance:** Everyone will be present at meetings.
- **Preparedness:** Everyone comes to meetings having completed their agreed tasks, reviewed the agenda, and looked at any shared documents or code that will be discussed.
- **Engagement:** During meetings, everyone participates in the discussion, listens to others, and raises concerns or ideas. Side conversations or multitasking should be kept to a minimum so we stay focused.
- **Documentation:** Meetings minutes and decisions will be recorded in a shared space (Discord) within 24 hours of each meeting.

### Communication and Collaboration

- **Frequency of Communication:** Communication will be done on Discord. Everyone will check messages at least once per day and respond to direct questions within twenty four hours.
- **Communication Behaviour:** All communication must remain respectful and professional. There will be no insults, sarcasm aimed at team members, or inappropriate jokes. If there is a misunderstanding, we will clarify rather than assume with bad intent.
- **Channels for Discussions:** Quick questions and updates happen in the discord channel. Planning and major decisions happen in scheduled meetings or voice calls. Technical issues and tasks are tracked in a kanban board so that work is visible to everyone.
- **Collaboration Process:** If two or more members are collaborating on a task, they will first agree on a clear goal, delegate responsibilities. They will keep each other updated on progress and blockers, and review each other’s work before presenting it to the rest of the group.

## Resolution Strategy

**In the event of a conflict, we will:**

1. Seek to understand the interests and concerns of each party involved before arriving at any conclusion.
2. Speak and listen without judgement or aggression, and respond with constructive, specific feedback.
3. NOT involve any personal issues or disagreements outside the scope of the capstone project.
4. Document key decisions and agreed-upon action items so expectations are clear to everyone.

**In the event a member wants to execute the Firing Clause, we will:**

1. Communicate directly with the member in question, clearly explaining the concerns.
2. Provide a reasonable timeline and concrete expectations for improvement.
3. Document all major discussions and warnings related to performance or behaviour.
4. Revisit after the agreed-upon timeline to assess efforts of improvement and whether change has been made.

Firing will only be considered as a last resort, after attempts have been made to resolve the issue. Additionally, all members must be in agreement and the final decision must be unanimous.

## Distribution and delivery of work

**Tasks:** Project tasks are defined in the GitHub README and Issues tab.
**Task Pick Up:** After the initial WBS is posted, each member claims the same number of major tasks, refines them in a shared Google Doc, then moves them into the README and creates/assigns matching GitHub issues.
**Task Delegation:** Because everyone’s tasks are clearly assigned from the beginning, conflicts occur at a minimum. The team will meet regularly to support progressing towards the end product. If conflicts arise, team members will communicate actively to resolve them and/or collectively choose the best solution.
**Task Accountability:** Each issue will have a clear assignee(s) and rough due date (end of each cycle); the assignee will be responsible for completing it on time with acceptable quality. Work will only be merged after approved peer reviews.

### Statement on commitment to avoid inappropriate behavior

1. **Respectful Environment**

- We will treat each other with respect regardless of background, identity, or skill level. Discriminatory or harassing behaviours will not be accepted in any form.

2. **Academic Integrity**
   
- All work will follow the course and university rules. We will not plagiarize, share forbidden materials, or misrepresent our contributions.

3. **Professional Conduct Online and In Person**

- Messages, comments, and code reviews must stay constructive. We will focus on the work, not personal attacks. When giving feedback, we will address the task or behaviour, not the person.

## Other ground rules

1. **Take responsibility for mistakes:** When something goes wrong, we own it, fix it, and learn from it without hiding or shifting blame.

2. **Honour meeting norms:** We arrive on time, stay focused, and let people finish their thoughts. Cameras and mics are used appropriately during virtual meetings.

I am committed to contributing to a team environment where everyone feels respected, supported, and able to work safely. I will treat my teammates with fairness, listen actively, and communicate in a way that maintains a positive and collaborative atmosphere. I understand that a respectful environment is essential for trust and effective teamwork.
I also commit to upholding academic integrity in all shared work. This includes being honest about my contributions, completing tasks responsibly, and following course and institutional guidelines. I recognize that integrity within a team protects the quality of our work and ensures that every member’s efforts are acknowledged.
I will conduct myself professionally both online and in person. This means communicating thoughtfully, using appropriate language, being mindful of tone, and avoiding any behaviour that could harm or undermine others. I will take responsibility for my actions, and when unsure about expectations, I will seek clarification rather than make assumptions.
My goal is to support a team culture built on respect, honesty, and professionalism, so that every member can participate comfortably and contribute meaningfully.
