## 📝 Project Overview

![Course](https://img.shields.io/badge/Course-COSC%20499-blue)
![Term](https://img.shields.io/badge/Term-Winter%202025-green)
![Tech Stack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tech%20Stack-Python-yellow)

This project is being developed as part of **COSC 499: Capstone Project** at UBCO.  
The project, titled **Mining Digital Work Artifacts**, is a tool designed to help individuals analyze and reflect on their digital creative and professional output. The main focus is on extracting and analyzing artifacts generated during the course of everyday work activities, including **Programming code**, **Repositories**, **documents**, **notes**, **design sketches** and **media files**. Through the collection of the users data and associated metadata, the system will provide insight into the user's contribution, creative direction, and project evolution. This will allow the user/individual to gain better insight into their work habits, showcase their contributions, and highlight their personal growth.


The platforms target users are **graduating students** and **early career professionals** who want to improve their **personal portfolio**

Please look at our [video](https://youtu.be/zAoHiW9vn-U) demo otherwise follow the steps below:


### Docker Setup

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Remove previous containers and volumes:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   ```

2. **Build the Docker containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```

3. **Start the Ollama container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d ollama2
   ```

4. **Pull the LLM model:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ollama2 ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b
   ```

5. **Verify the model is installed:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ollama2 ollama list
   ```
   You should see `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` in the list:

6. **Start the database container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d app_database
   ```

7. **Verify all containers are running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                               NAMES

#### Quick Setup (Single Command) Docker Setup

Alternatively, run everything in one command:

**CMD / macOS / Linux:**
```bash
docker-compose down -v && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d ollama2 && sleep 5 && docker exec -it ollama2 ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b && docker-compose up -d app_database
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
docker-compose down -v; docker-compose build --no-cache; docker-compose up -d ollama2; Start-Sleep 5; docker exec -it ollama2 ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b; docker-compose up -d app_database
```

### Set up Environment Variables
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root folder with the following:
   
   ![alt text](image-1.png)
   
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys.
   
   | Variable | Purpose | Setup Guide |
   |----------|---------|-------------|
   | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Required for AI-Powered Resume | [PR #188](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-2/pull/188) |
   | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Required for GitHub contributor analysis | [PR #161](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-2/pull/161) |

   2. Sign in with your Google account
   3. Click **"Create API Key"**
   4. Select an existing Google Cloud project or create a new one
   5. Copy the generated API key
   6. Paste it into your `.env` file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here`

   > 💡 **Tip:** The free tier includes generous usage limits for development and testing.

#### 🐙 GitHub Token Setup
  
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d529d9b5-9867-4dee-961d-02bfbdd1f371

   1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Fine-grained tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
   2. Click **"Generate new token"**, making sure that you are on a fine-grained token tab
   3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., `capstone-project-analysis`)
   4. Set an expiration date
   5. Under **Repository access**, select the repositories you want to analyze (or "All repositories")
   <img width="1798" height="1209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87e19535-bd64-4fc2-8428-b7f432943053" />

   6. Under **Permissions**, expand **"Repository permissions"** and set:
      - `Contents` → **Read and Write**
      - `Metadata` → **Read-only** (usually enabled by default)
      - `Administration` → **Read and Write**
   7. Click **"Generate token"**
   8. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again!)
   9. Paste it into your `.env` file as `GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here`

   > ⚠️ **Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Make sure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore`.


### Python Setup

1. **Navigate to the project folder:**
```bash
cd capstone-project-team-2
```
   > 📝 **Note:** If you cloned to a custom directory, replace `capstone-project-team-2` with your chosen folder name.

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application:**
```bash
python src/main.py
```
   
   Or alternatively:
```bash
python -m src.main
```

## Key Components

- **Frontend (Presentation Layer)**: Built using **Streamlit** or **FreeSimpleGUI**, offering an intuitive menu-driven interface for users to navigate and interact with the application. Key features include:
  - **Interactive menus**: For project analysis, viewing saved projects, portfolio generation, and configuration management.
  - **User consent workflow**: Guides users through the process of providing consent and configuring permissions for external services permissions
  - **Portfolio generation**: Enables users to generate a portfolio-ready resume or portfolio 

- **Backend (Application Layer)**: The backend powers the core analysis engine, leveraging multiple technologies for comprehensive project insights
  - **File Processing**: Handles ZIP extraction, directory traversal, and metadata collection achieved using `os`, `shutil`, `zipfile`, and `pathlib`.
  - **Multi-language OOP Analysis**: Analyzes Python source files via the `ast` module and for Java source files via the `javalang` module. Returning unified metrics on **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, **polymorphism**, and **code complexity**
  - **AI-Powered Analysis**: Integrates with **Ollama** (via LangChain library) for local LLM-based code review and **Google Gemini** for improved code review and for generating prototype-ready project summaries
  - **Contributor Detection**: Identifies project collaborators through git history (via **GitPython** and **PyGithub**) or file metadata analysis for non-git projects
  - **Stack Detection**: Automatically identifies programming languages, frameworks, and skills through scanning dependency files (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `composer.json`) and source file extensions

- **Database (Storage Layer)**: 
  - The application uses **MySQL** as its primary database for persistent storage and data management.
  - **Project Data Storage**: Stores analyzed project metadata, JSON analysis reports, and file blobs for later retrieval.
  - **Containerized Deployment**: MySQL runs within a Docker container (`app_database`), with connection details dynamically set and found in the `DockerFinder` utility.

- **External Services Integration**:
  - **Google Gemini API**: Powers AI-generated resume summaries and project descriptions (requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)

**Design Principles**

- **Loose coupling** – Components interact through well-defined interfaces
- **Scalability through modularity** – Each module can be developed and tested independently
- **Reusability and maintainability** – Code organization supports easy updates and debugging
