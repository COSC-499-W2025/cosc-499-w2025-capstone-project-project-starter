# Week 9 Personal Log (Oct 27th – Nov 2nd)

This week I began implementing **Issue #29: Identify Individual Contributions Within a Collaborative Project**, which focuses on mapping file authorship and contributions across Git repositories. I also reviewed **PR #107** (Development bug fixes) and **PR #109** (Issue #19: Solve Projects Chronologically), providing feedback to ensure smooth functionality and consistent testing coverage. In addition, I resolved merge conflicts between the **Contribution Metrics** feature branch and the **Development** branch to maintain alignment across ongoing feature work. Lastly, I completed my individual log for this cycle.

Overall, the week went well, I made pretty good progress on my assigned issue, but had to spend time refacotring after other pushes. All tests ran successfully after the merge. However, resolving the couple merge conflicts highlighted the need for clearer team communication about where and when changes are being made in the repository. Improving coordination will help prevent overlapping edits and make integration smoother in future cycles. I also learned more about how different features interact across modules, which will help with upcoming implementation work.

# Week 10 Personal Log (Nov 3rd – Nov 9th)

This week i had some midterms so I focused on implementing a bug fix for my previous task related to the contribution summary. My fix (PR #133) refined the data handling and ensured that the contribution summary correctly reports the number of files changed and which specific files were modified per contributor. This update aligned the results with the latest database persistence changes and improved overall reporting accuracy. After applying the fix, all related tests passed successfully, confirming stable integration across modules. 

In addition to the bug fix, I participated in peer code reviews for PR #131 (Database persistence integration) and PR #134 (File metadata handling improvements). These reviews focused on verifying data consistency, testing reliability, and adherence to project design standards. Overall, the week was productive in maintaining stability and supporting team progress toward our milestone, as are starting to deepen the analysis of out features

---

# Week 12 Personal Log (Nov 10th – Nov 23rd)

This week I implemented a new contributor-focused project summarization feature. My update (PR #158) added a full implementation of `summarize_projects.py`, which analyzes a contributor’s top-ranked projects from the database, gathers project metadata, and generates one combined summary file. The summary includes languages, skills, frameworks, contribution metrics, ranking breakdowns, and per-project details. The feature resolves project paths, handles missing/invalid paths, aggregates all stats cleanly, and produces a readable multi-section report. It’s completely standalone and can be run manually through the CLI without affecting the main scanning pipeline. I also added a comprehensive test suite covering path resolution, skipping invalid projects, info-gathering behavior, error handling, and limit enforcement. All automated tests passed, and manual runs produced correct summary files.

As a group, I feel we had a solid week. We expanded our reporting tools and kept everything aligned as we move toward the end of Milestone 1. Over the next couple of weeks, we’ll need to come together to tighten up our product for the demo, which I believe we will.

---

# Week 13 Personal Log (Nov 24th – Nov 30th)

This week I implemented the full `main_menu.py` module (PR #181), which now acts as the unified CLI interface for all major MDA features. The menu consolidates scanning, ranking, project summaries, and full database inspection into one consistent entry point. The update includes a complete set of helper utilities, support for per-project and contributor-level reporting, and a much cleaner workflow for interacting with the SQLite database. I also added a full test suite (`test_main_menu.py`) that covers the deterministic logic in the module, including `safe_query()`, `human_ts()`, and the database inspection handler. All tests passed successfully, and the new menu structure should make the user-facing experience much more organized heading into Milestone 1.

As a group, we also spent time preparing and refining our presentation slides for the Milestone 1 demo. We synced our individual logs, reviewed each other's PRs, and made sure the reporting and analysis features aligned well with what we want to showcase. Overall, it was a productive week, and I feel confident with where our project stands heading into the final stretch of Milestone 1.

# Week 14 Personal Log (Dec 1st – Dec 7th)

This week was busy as our team wrapped up the remaining Milestone 1 tasks and finalized our deliverables. We divided the remaining work across the group, and I focused on a mix of development fixes, architecture updates, and documentation as most of our coding was done.

One of my main contributions was **PR #212**, which fixes a Windows file path issue that caused summary generation to fail. The update standardizes how paths are parsed and makes the summary and reporting tools work consistently across both macOS and Windows environments. I also spent time updating our **system architecture diagram** so it accurately reflects the Milestone 1 implementation. This included organizing the layers, clarifying the flow between the CLI, scanners, detection engine, and database, and adding the resume output and consent/config elements. The updated diagram now gives a clean, accurate overview of how the system behaves end-to-end.

I feel it has been a succecsul milestone/semester and am happy with where our project is at thus far.

# Semester 2 – Week 1 Personal Log (January 5th - 11th, 2026)

During the first week of Semester 2, the team regrouped following the reading break to transition into Milestone 2 development. We reviewed feedback from Milestone 1, clarified technical priorities, and began implementing features aimed at strengthening project traceability and portfolio readiness. My primary focus this week was contributing to the backend design and CLI integration of the Project Evidence module, establishing infrastructure to support richer reporting and résumé-generation outputs later in the milestone.

Overall, this was a highly productive first week back. Establishing a clean, testable evidence layer early in Milestone 2 positions the team well for building more advanced reporting and export features, and I’m excited to see how it integrates with our existing contribution metrics.

# Semester 2 – Week 2 Personal Log (January 12th – 18th, 2026)

During Week 2 of Semester 2, my focus shifted toward completing the full integration of the Project Evidence feature across downstream outputs and reviewing ongoing team contributions as Milestone 2 development continued. Building on the backend and CLI groundwork established last week, I finalized the flow for surfacing evidence data within résumé and portfolio generation pipelines, ensuring the feature was end-to-end complete and aligned with Milestone 2 objectives. In parallel, I spent time reviewing teammate pull requests and researching potential LLM options to inform future integration decisions.

This week felt like a strong follow-through on earlier design decisions. Completing the evidence integration into résumé and portfolio outputs closes a major Milestone 2 feature and significantly improves the system’s ability to generate meaningful, evidence-backed artifacts.

<img width="981" height="629" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 3 29 09 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c48a6f0-6430-4a27-9400-9f65cafce1c5" />

# Semester 2 – Week 3 Personal Log (January 19th – January 25th, 2026)

This week the team focused primarily on stabilization and polish in preparation for upcoming peer testing. Rather than introducing new features, we prioritized addressing bugs, cleanup tasks, identified through Milestone 1 feedback. This allowed us to improve overall system reliability and ensure existing functionality behaves consistently ahead of external testing.

My individual work focused on fixing correctness issues in contributor-based reporting and improving the reliability of summary-generation workflows. I resolved a bug in portfolio generation where git-tracked projects were incorrectly included even when the selected user was not a contributor. I also improved summarize_projects.py workflow based on Milestone 1 feedback. This included adding a guided contributor-selection prompt to the CLI, fixing an issue where per-contributor commit counts were incorrectly reported as zero, and ensuring summaries correctly reflect the selected contributor’s commits while preserving total project metrics. I will look into switching this feature to pull project info from Db next week.


<img width="1118" height="650" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-25 at 7 19 24 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f1a373d-5788-4e77-9fb6-0b754da69295" />


## Coding Tasks
- Fixed portfolio aggregation logic to exclude git-tracked projects when the selected user is not a contributor, while preserving support for non-git and solo projects (PR #291)  
- Improved the **Summarize Contributor Projects** workflow based on Milestone 1 feedback, including guided contributor selection and more accurate contributor-specific commit reporting (PR #315)  
- Corrected per-contributor commit count handling to ensure summaries reflect the selected user’s actual commits while preserving overall project Git metrics
- Hardened zip-based project handling to prevent invalid or multi-project directories from being summarized silently  

## Testing Tasks
- Added unit test `test_aggregate_projects_excludes_non_contributor_git_project` in `test_generate_portfolio.py` to verify portfolio aggregation excludes non-contributor git projects  
- Added new unit tests in `test_summarize_projects.py` to validate contributor-based summary fixes:
  - `test_contributor_commit_count_is_used`
  - `test_skills_are_populated_correctly`
  - `test_fallback_to_contributions_commits`
- Performed manual CLI testing via `main_menu.py` to verify contributor selection, summary accuracy, and zip-based project handling  

## Reviewing / Collaboration Tasks
- Reviewed **Docker updates & test suite refactors** (PR #288)  
- Reviewed **Add project résumé display name editing** (PR #294)  
- Reviewed **Added tests for nested folders** (PR #300)  
- Coordinated with teammates to align on Milestone 2 priorities and upcoming integration work  

<img width="1103" height="148" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-25 at 8 25 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0ac3304-973f-4d67-bbf5-2528a457f3f4" />

# Semester 2 – Weeks 4 + 5 Personal Log (January 26th – February 8th, 2026)

During Weeks 4 and 5 of Semester 2, the team continued Milestone 2 development with a strong focus on reliability, usability, and polish. During **Week 4**, we conducted peer testing, which helped surface a concrete list of bugs, usability issues, and unclear workflows across the system. Based on this feedback, we shifted focus away from adding new features and instead prioritized implementing fixes and refinements identified through peer testing.

In Week 4, I completed **PR #326**, which refactored project summary generation to rely exclusively on database-backed data rather than filesystem scans. This change significantly improved performance, consistency, and correctness by ensuring summaries reflect the canonical persisted state of the system. The update also included additional initialization checks and new tests to guard against invalid or incomplete database state.

In Week 5, my focus shifted toward UX polish and clarity in Milestone 2 features. I addressed confusing terminology in the **Project Evidence** workflow by renaming and re-framing labels to better communicate intent to users (e.g., “Evidence of Success”), improving overall usability and reducing cognitive overhead. I also began work on refining the file extension filtering experience in the scanning workflow, evaluating whether the prompt should be clarified or removed entirely based on user feedback.

# Semester 2 – Weeks 6–8 Personal Log (February 9th – March 1st, 2026)

During Weeks 6 through 8, the team transitioned from stabilizing Milestone 2 features toward beginning early groundwork for Milestone 3. Week 7 was our Reading Break (counted as a bonus week), during which development slowed, but planning and research continued. Across this period, my focus shifted toward preparing our system for frontend integration and ensuring backend endpoints were structured appropriately for visualization and external access.

In Week 6, I contributed to backend improvements supporting milestone transition work (PR #385). This included refining API-related functionality to ensure it remained consistent and reliable as we prepared to expose more structured data externally.

During Week 8, I completed PR #392, which involved scaffolding an initial Electron + Vite frontend and testing backend connectivity. Alongside implementation, I spent time researching best practices for structuring a successful frontend architecture that cleanly connects to our FastAPI backend. This research focused on project structure, API routing patterns, and separation of concerns to ensure our frontend remains maintainable as Milestone 3 visualization features expand.

In addition to development work, we prepared and delivered our Milestone 2 presentation, reviewing system improvements, demonstration flows, and integration decisions made throughout the milestone.

# Semester 2 – Week 9 Personal Log (March 2nd – March 8th, 2026)

This week began with preparation for **Quiz 3**, so the early portion of the week was dedicated to reviewing API endpoint design, backend integration patterns, and testing strategies. After the quiz, development continued with focused progress on Milestone 3 frontend integration and resume-generation functionality.

Through **PR #417**, I implemented a one-command startup workflow for the full application stack. Previously, the FastAPI backend had to be launched manually before starting the Electron frontend. This update introduced a `/health` endpoint in the FastAPI app and added child-process spawn logic within Electron’s main process. The backend is now automatically started, polled until ready, and cleanly terminated on all exit scenarios (including macOS window-close). This significantly improves developer experience and reduces setup friction.

In **PR #422**, I implemented the initial **Generate Resume** page in the frontend. Users can now:
- Select a contributor via `GET /contributors`
- Generate a resume via `POST /resume/generate`
- Retrieve and render the result as markdown
- Edit the resume inline via `POST /resume/{id}/edit`
- Copy content to clipboard
- Download the resume as a `.md` file

This PR also introduced blacklist filtering in the contributors endpoint to ensure only valid contributors are selectable. Tailwind CSS configuration was added experimentally

## Coding Tasks
- Implemented backend `/health` endpoint for readiness checks (PR #417)  
- Added Electron child-process spawn logic to auto-start FastAPI backend (PR #417)  
- Implemented clean shutdown handling for backend process across exit scenarios (PR #417)

# Semester 2 – Week 10 Personal Log (March 9th – March 15th, 2026)

During Week 10, my primary focus shifted toward a large-scale frontend refactor and UI redesign to improve structure, consistency, and responsiveness across Milestone 3 features. After implementing core resume-generation functionality in Week 9, this week centered on unifying the design system and strengthening resume UX with expanded backend support.

I began by refactoring the main application structure in **PR #438 (Redesign App.jsx)**, reorganizing layout logic and cleaning up routing and component composition to make future visualization work easier to integrate. Following this, I updated the frontend test suite in **PR #441** to ensure tests aligned with the refactored structure and continued to provide reliable coverage.

The majority of the week was dedicated to a three-part CSS redesign:

- **PR #444** – Redesign index.css part 1/3: core, base, and shared components  
- **PR #445** – Redesign index.css part 2/3: scan and rank page styles  
- **PR #447** – Redesign index.css 3/3: portfolio, scanned projects, and responsiveness  

These updates standardized spacing, typography, layout containers, and reusable UI patterns. The redesign improved responsiveness across screen sizes and reduced duplicated styling logic. Splitting the redesign into three focused PRs kept reviews manageable and reduced merge complexity.

In parallel, I implemented **PR #449 (Resume page enhancements)**, which introduced new UX capabilities and supporting backend endpoints for LLM configuration and resume history.

Key enhancements included:

- **LLM Summary via Ollama** — added a checkbox allowing users to optionally include a locally generated AI summary in their resume. The feature is gated behind `llm_resume_consent` and includes an inline consent panel that calls the existing `/privacy-consent` endpoint.
- **Multi-format downloads** — replaced the single `.md` download button with `.md`, `.txt`, and `.pdf` export options. The `.pdf` export uses browser print via a hidden iframe (no additional dependencies). While basic download functionality works, `.txt` and `.pdf` formatting fidelity require further refinement.
- Added supporting backend endpoints:
  - `GET /config` — returns current consent flags without mutating state  
  - `GET /resumes` — lists saved resumes with optional `username` filter and `llm_used` flag  
  - Refactored `GET /contributors` — added blacklist filtering and consistent sorting  

Overall, this week significantly improved frontend maintainability, UI consistency, and resume-generation capabilities.

# Semester 2 – Weeks 11–12 Personal Log (March 16th – March 29th, 2026)

During Weeks 11–12, my primary focus was refining and stabilizing the resume generation workflow as we prepared for Milestone 3 delivery. I concentrated on improving the end-to-end resume lifecycle, including enabling resume deletion, enhancing the PDF rendering pipeline, and expanding resume content support.

A key improvement during this phase was enforcing consistent PDF generation by removing the WeasyPrint dependency and standardizing on a ReportLab-only rendering approach. This reduced dependency complexity and improved cross-environment reliability. I also strengthened multi-format export handling and validated rendering stability across edge cases.

On the frontend, I supported enhancements to the resume experience by integrating an education section with collapsible UI behavior and ensuring resume deletion was properly handled through both backend endpoints and the trashcan interface. These updates helped complete the resume lifecycle from generation to modification to removal.

In addition to implementation work, I authored the Milestone 3 Test Report documentation, outlining our unit, integration, and manual testing strategies and clearly mapping test coverage to milestone requirements. I also participated in the Week 11 peer testing demo session and contributed to the development and delivery of the Milestone 3 presentation in Week 12.

Overall, these weeks focused on polishing the resume generation pipeline, strengthening export reliability, and ensuring the system was stable, well-documented, and presentation-ready.
