### Recap of Week's Goals

Improve performance of the ZIP file parsing and validation system.
Reduce redundant operations such as multiple ZIP file openings and repeated decompression.
Maintain method names and existing functionality to avoid breaking changes.
Ensure all improvements are validated through automated tests.
Clean up code to improve readability and long-term maintainability.

---

### Features Assigned (Project Plan)

Performance Optimization: Reduce unnecessary operations in ZIP validation and extraction logic.
Refactor for Efficiency: Reuse the same ZipFile handle instead of reopening archives multiple times.
Redundancy Removal: Eliminate repeated metadata reads and double decompression.
Test Alignment: Update and correct test cases to match optimized behavior.
Memory Efficiency: Skip directory entries when building the file tree.

---

### Tasks from Project Board

| Task | Status (Completed/In Progress) | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------|------|
| Remove redundant ZIP file openings | ✅ Completed | Reused a single `ZipFile` handle for validation and extraction |
| Eliminate unnecessary decompression (`testzip`) | ✅ Completed | Removed expensive default full-archive scan for performance |
| Reuse metadata from `infolist()` | ✅ Completed | Prevented redundant re-reads of archive metadata |
| Filter directory entries from file tree | ✅ Completed | Reduced memory usage and improved output quality |
| Update and align unit tests | ✅ Completed | Modified tests to reflect optimized and corrected behavior |
| Clean up comments and structure | ✅ Completed | Improved readability without changing public interfaces |
---

### Completed/In-Progress Tasks (Last 2 Weeks)

Optimized check_file_validity by avoiding multiple ZIP file reads.
Updated extract_zip_to_temp to accept an existing zip_ref and prevent reopening.
Improved file tree generation performance by filtering non-file entries.
Refactored and clarified test cases to match the actual logic.
Ensured no breaking changes through consistent function names and behavior.
Planning further performance improvements via streamed extraction and generator-based file loading (future work).

---

### Additional Context (Optional)

This week focused on improving efficiency and maintainability without changing the external API. By removing redundant operations and unnecessary decompression passes, ZIP processing is now significantly faster and more resource-efficient, especially for large files. These changes make the system more scalable while preserving full backward compatibility. Next steps include exploring streamed extraction and lazy loading for even larger archives.
