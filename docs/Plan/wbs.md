# Milestone #1
The focus of this milestone is to create the functionality for parsing and outputting information correctly. We will be very particular about your system design and testing approach during this phase. All the output for this milestone is expected to be in text (that is, you can opt for a CSV, JSON, plain text output, etc., or a combination that facilitates your future development). The specific requirements are below.
The system must be able to ... :

## 1.0 User Interaction and Consent Module
  - 1.1 Data Access Consent
      - 1.1.1 Display user consent dialog before data access
      - 1.1.2 Record and store consent decision
      - 1.1.3 Block operations for users who have not granted consent
  - 1.2 External Service Permission
      - 1.2.1 Request explicit permission to use external LLM or APIs
      - 1.2.2 Display privacy implications and data usage details
      - 1.2.3 Implement fallback (local) analysis if external service is not approved

## 2.0 Parse a specified zipped folder containing nested folders and files
  - 2.1 Verify the .zip extension
  - 2.2 Iterate through nested folders inside the zip
  - 2.3 For each file: extract path, size, modified time
  - 2.4 Build artifact records with unique IDs
  - 2.5 Store parsed metadata as JSON lines
  - 2.6 Generate summary: number of files, total bytes, scan duration

## 3.0 Return an error if the specified file is in the wrong format
  - 3.1 Detect non-zip inputs (e.g .pdf, .jpg .exe)
  - 3.2 Define standard error schema: { "error": "InvalidInput", "detail": "..."}
  - 3.3 Store the error logs

## 4.0 Request User Permission Before Using External Services
  - 4.1 Current Status
      - At this stage of the project (Milestone #1), the system does not use any online tools or AI models (like LLMs). All analysis happens locally on the user’s computer. However, this module prepares the system for future milestones where online or AI-based features might be added (for example, a cloud analysis tool or an AI summary generator).
  - 4.2 Consent and Transparency
      - Whenever external processing is introduced in the future, the system will:
          - Display a clear consent message before any data is shared.
      - Inform the user about:
          - What data will be sent (e.g., text or metadata).
          - Why it is being sent (e.g., for generating summaries or analytics).
          - Where it is going (e.g., a trusted API).
          - How privacy and data storage are handled.
          - Offer options to Allow Once, Always Allow, or Deny, and remember the user’s choice.
          - Record each response with a date, time, and user ID for transparency.
          - Block any external request if permission is denied.
  - 4.3 Expected Outcome
      - Users clearly understand any future privacy implications and will always have control over their data.
      - During this milestone, no data leaves the computer, and the system remains fully local and privacy-safe.

## 5.0 Have Alternative Analyses in Place If Sending Data to an External Service Is Not Permitted
  - 5.1 Purpose
      - Ensure the software continues to function completely even when users do not allow online processing or when the computer is offline.
  - 5.2 Implementation Plan
      - Provide offline (local) analysis options for all major features, such as detecting programming languages, skills, and user contributions.
      - Only disable optional online tools (for example, AI summaries) if permission is denied.
      - Keep the same output style (JSON, CSV, or text) for both online and offline modes.
      - Display a small “Local Analysis Mode” label so users know their data is being processed only on their computer.
      - Test both local and online modes to confirm that results remain consistent.
  - 5.3 Expected Outcome
      - The system stays fully operational, accurate, and privacy-friendly even without internet access or user consent for external processing.

## 6.0 Store User Configurations for Future Use
  - 6.1 Purpose
      - Save each user’s settings and preferences so they do not have to reset everything every time they open the program.
  - 6.2 Implementation Plan
      - Store preferences such as last opened folder, analysis mode, and theme in a small configuration file or database table.
      - Include the user’s consent choice in these saved settings.
      - Protect private details through basic encryption.
      - Automatically load saved settings when the program starts.
      - Provide a “Reset Settings” button to restore default values.
      - Update saved settings whenever the user changes preferences.
  - 6.3 Expected Outcome
      - User configurations are remembered across sessions, creating a smooth, consistent, and personalized experience each time the software is used.

## 7.0 Distinguish Individual Projects from Collaborative Projects
  - 7.1 Purpose
      - Identify whether a project was completed by one person or by a team, so that contribution reports and rankings are fair and accurate.
  - 7.2 Implementation Plan
      - Review project information and Git commit logs to find how many contributors worked on each project.
      - Classify projects as:
          - Individual – one author only.
          - Collaborative – multiple contributors.
      - Measure the main user’s contribution level (e.g., number of commits or lines of code).
      - Exclude automated accounts or bots from the contributor count.
      - Show this information in project summaries, dashboards, and ranking lists.
  - 7.3 Expected Outcome
      - Each project is correctly labeled as individual or collaborative.
      - This allows fair evaluation of personal work and teamwork in reports and summaries.
