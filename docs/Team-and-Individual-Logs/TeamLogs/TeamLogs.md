## Weeks 3 - Sept 15-21, 2025
The features included in this milestone were to work together as a group, setting up necessary documentation such as google drive folder, setting up our capstone repository to work on our individual and team logs, working on our project requirements, and creating a project backlog within our repository. Due to the early stages of the project, the rest is unable to be done at the moment.

## Week 4 - Sept 22-28, 2025
The features for this week’s milestone was to revisit our project requirements, and construct our software architecture diagram. Collectively, each of our team members contributed to refining the requirements for our project, as well as discussing and suggesting ideas for the different components in our system architecture diagram. Additionally, our team worked on our project proposal/project plan document, in which we specified our tech stack, functional requirements, and assigned tasks to each of our team members.

This week, our team revised and made changes to our system architecture diagram, and data flow diagrams, reflecting the finalized project requirements. We also divided up the first few functions of our backend that we needed to implement, and assigned them to each of our team members, as well as updated our github repository. Some functions that our team started developing are checking file formats, distinguishing individual projects from collaborative projects, adding permissions to collect and analyze the users data, as well as permissions to use external services for analysis. Our team also worked on developing a “testConsole” skeleton to test our functions.

## Week 7 Team Log  
**Date Range:** Oct 13 – Oct 19, 2025  

| Team Member | Work Completed / Focus This Week | Related Issue # |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **T’Olu Akinwande** | Developed and tested the `extrapolate_individual_contributions()` function to estimate member contribution percentages across parsed projects (issue #16). Also revised the `projectCollabType` function (issue #14) to replace dummy data with real metadata fields and reviewed PRs for alignment and code consistency. | #14, #16 |
| **Prina Mehta** | Implemented file-path input and parsing pipeline so the system automatically reads and processes CSV, JSON, TXT, PY, and ZIP formats. Enhanced directory-crawler logic for multi-file projects. | #2 |
| **Maya Knutsvig** | Completed framework/language identifier module to detect project type based on codebase structure (e.g., Python vs web). Integrated detection with the file-parser output. | #8 |
| **Jackson Wilson** | Built RAKE-based keyword extraction system for text files to summarize important phrases and skills. Updated `testConsole.py` for manual testing and added sample data for validation. | #52 |
| **Illina Islam** | Implemented `projects` database schema for storing project and metadata entries using SQLAlchemy. Updated `README.md` and began connecting database to processing pipeline. | #13 |
| **Sana Shah** | Created `visualMediaAnalyzer` function to scan media files and infer which design software was used, mapping outputs to associated skills. Initial implementation complete (no AI integration yet). | #54 |

# Test Report
All tests were written in Python and executed successfully.  
Unit tests were created for each major function (e.g., `extrapolate_individual_contributions()`, `fileParser`, `projectCollabType`).  
Manual testing through `testConsole.py` also confirmed that all modules work as expected with sample project data.

### Reflection Points
**What went well:**  
- The new modular approach helped integrate multiple features smoothly.  
- Each member worked independently on key components that connected successfully during testing.  
- Collaboration during PR reviews improved overall code consistency.  

**What didn’t go as planned:**  
- Merge conflicts across multiple branches slowed integration.  
- The database still isn’t fully connected to other system components.  
- Some manual testing processes (like the console dashboard) remain time-intensive.

### Reflection Points

**What went well:**  
- During our team meeting this week, all team members, collectively revised our systems pipeline, in order to clarify and review progress on our functions, and the system as a whole. This allowed us to proritize which functions needed to be implemented first, moving forward.
- Team members worked independently on different functions of the system.
- Lots of ideas were shared and agreed upon over the week, collectively.

**What didn't go as planned:**  
- Our team decided that it would be more efficient for us to automate tests for our functions, so some of our older test files had to be refactored.

**Reflection Points:**

**What went well:**  
- The team collaborated effectively and made steady progress in multiple areas, including AI integration, database expansion, and analysis module refinement.  
- Testing across different features showed consistent outputs, confirming smooth communication between modules.  
- Collaboration and code reviews helped maintain a unified structure across all functions.

**What didn’t go as planned:**  
- Some minor test import path issues occurred when switching branches - we just need to keep activitely updating the dependcies document so we know what to install before running our files to avoid errors. 
- Running all project tests together took longer than expected, as some modules required large sample data to validate.

# Test Report
All tests were written in Python and executed successfully, other than analysis using LLM which is currently not working due to API key generation, but we are currently working on resolving it. For each of the functions in our system, we have implemented unit tests. Manual testing can be done through `main.py` and it confirms that all modules work as expected with sample project data, after refactoring

### Reflection Points

**What went well:**  
- The team collaborated effectively and made progress with the last few function implementations, and refactoring existing functions.
- Team members worked independently and collaboritvely, to refactor main.py.

**What didn't go as planned:**  
- Some of our inputs for different project types were not uniform through the system, so we had to refactor some existing functions, as well as main.py, to ensure that they accept intended file types, and analyzes them accordingly, for each project/digitalartifact type.

## Term 2 Week 4 Team Log  
**Date Range:** Jan 26 - Feb 1, 2026  

| Team Member | Work Completed / Focus This Week | Related Issue # |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **T’Olu Akinwande** | Implemented an incremental skill extraction module to ensure that newly added or modified files. This adds support for incremental skill extraction by detecting newly introduced libarries from import statements in newly added or modified files. This ensures project skills stay up to date during incremental scans without requiring a full re-scan | #296 |
| **Prina Mehta** | Implemented evidence management system that automatically extracts and stores success metrics from project files and allows users to manually add metrics, feedback and achievements to their project | #223 |
| **Maya Knutsvig** | Focus was bugs that were detected during peer testing. This includes having consistent wording in our user-menu as well as consistent numbering. Added settings in the main menu as well as changed coding scanner to fix "lines of code" and "date" bug. Also formatted the time to use the user's time for displaying and not UTC. | #288 #285 #282 #275|
| **Jackson Wilson** | Changed success score which was initially arbitrary into using importance score and changed the scale to be out of 100% rather than 0-1. Additionally did some housekeeping, by deleting testConsole which was a redundant file and modified the PR template so that it did not have pre-existing example.  | #284  |
| **Illina Islam** | Worked on fixing bugs in the resume bullet and generation functions caught during peer testing. Additionally, added necessary function in database to begin generation of user profiles. | #299 #281 #297 |
| **Sana Shah** | Refactored coding projet scanner and skill extractor. Skills were not previously available, displayed nor stored properly in the database for coding projects. This update changed coding project scanner to correctly call skills extraction function and properly store it in the database. The coding skills extraction function now properly counts top-level skills and displays corresponding sub-skills for that category | #337|

# Test Report
All tests were written in Python and executed successfully.  
Unit tests were created for each major function (e.g., `test_portofolioFormatter(), test_database(), etc`).  
Manual testing through `main.py` also confirmed that all modules work as expected with sample project data.

### Reflection Points
**What went well:**  
- Positive contributions this week toward bugb fixing and milestone 2 requirements keeping the team on track
- PR sent in at proper times

**What didn’t go as planned:**  
- Better communication on who is doing what needs to be implemented in future sprint because the team encountered 2 people working on the same file and over-writing each other's work.

### Reflection Points
**What went well:**  
- Many of us had 4-5 midterms this week, so progress was slower than usual, but we are still on track for completing Milestone 2 Requirements before the deadline.

**What didn’t go as planned:**  
- Some PRs were not approved on time due to unavailability from exam week.

### Reflection Points
**What went well:**  
- Successfully prepared for the presentation.

**What didn’t go as planned:**  
- As this was reading break, and we were not required to do anything, we believe we did more than required as many of us still kept up with coding PRs and ensured we were on track. 


## Term 2 Week 8 Team Log

| **Illina Islam** |Signup endpoint --> For account creation; User provides email/password → Password gets hashed (bcrypt) → User saved to database → JWT token generated with user_id → Token returned to user. Login endpoint --> For logging; User provides email/password → System checks if user exists → Verifies password hash matches → Generates new JWT token → Returns token. Using Token: User includes token in Authorization: Bearer header → Backend decodes token → Extracts user_id → Filters all data by that user_id. Me endpoint --> for checking current user (check if a user is logged in or not). Guest projects count endpoint --> for counting number of projects uploaded by a guest user. Guest Mode: No token provided → user_id is None → System shows only guest projects (where user_id IS NULL). Made changes to project endpoints to account for user id. Added thumbnail upload endpoint, only users who have accounts and are logged in can upload a thumbnail.
