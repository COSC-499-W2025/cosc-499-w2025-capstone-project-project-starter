    #Guide on how to merge your rebuilt system into this system
    #1. Import your class or methods and global variable
    #2. Initialize your class under __init__() to ensure data in your analyzer will persist between files
    #   or, reset a global variable storing your data directly or via a method if class not used
    #3. Build a constant list of suffixes under this class' attributes for use in sorting files into your analyzer
    #4. Under _sort_into_analyzers(), build an if statement to conditionally sort files you want
    #5. Under that if statement in _sort_into_analyzers(), place your method that takes a single file for analysis and pass "file" into it (file is a Path object)
    #6. Under build_analysis_with_project(), place the method that takes your aggregated results of the analzyer and place it in building_dict
    #If your system analyzes all file types, ignore steps 4 and 5 and don't place your method under an if statement in step 6
    #WARNING!!! Not adapting your system to analyze files individually, unless explained in detail how it would affect analysis results negatively,
    # will not be tolerated

    #Build list of suffixes that apply to your analyzer for use in sorting here
    #vvvvvv
