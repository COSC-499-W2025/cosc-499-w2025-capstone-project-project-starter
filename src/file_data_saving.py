Subject to change, but general idea. Must be dictionary.
Analysis of each file of hierarchy should be modelled in a dictionary as so:
Starting with project folder
{
"name": "project folder name"
"folders": [
        {
        "name": "folder name"
        "folders": [...]
        "files": [...]
        },
        ...
    ]
"files": [
        {
        "name": "file name"
        "file type": "file type"
        "file size": int
        "created": datetime
        "modified": datetime
        "author": "author"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
