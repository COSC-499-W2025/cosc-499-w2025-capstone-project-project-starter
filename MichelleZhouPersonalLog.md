<img width="966" height="566" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b127074f-4733-48f4-ba73-9ff5789437ad" />

### Week Recap: 
- Worked on 'Metrics Calculation Module' task #43
- Discussed new implementations with members
- Reviewed team member's PR and help test new features

This week i worked on implementing a unified metrics extraction module that ties together quantitative activity analysis and quantitative skill inferences. To start, I defined and formalized each core metric in order to identify the type of data the program should be looking for. Each metric type is then calculated alongside a contribution analysis to obtain an overview of the project activities/behaviour. The metrics:extract handler receives these details and passes them to analyzeMetrics() which returns with a summary of all key metrics. Lastly, I am working on outputting the metrics to the Electron UI. To do this, I am writing a renderer which will request the finalized data and present it as the corresponding activity patterns.

Aside from my own code, I assisted in troubleshooting pr's where feature/extract-key-skills resulted in many merge conflicts. My team and I also coordinated on new task assignments. We reviewed our progress thus far and are actively working towards milestone 1 completion.

### Next Week:
- Finish Metrics Calculation Module
- Start developing "Chronological List of Projects" task #67


## Week 9 Personal Log

- (Oct 27 - Nov 2, 2025)<br />

<img width="966" height="567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74837693-afd9-4c70-8351-38561a420fb0" />

### Week Recap: 
- Focused on converting codebase from javascript to python
- Started working on 'Chronologica List of Projects' task #67
- Discussed new feature implementations with team (outside of wbs)
- Reviewed team member's PR

This week, after our Wednesday check-in, my group and I prioritized converting our existing JavaScript codebase to Python. This transition took precedence over implementing any new features before any further development. In addition, I completed and refined the metrics calculation module feature. I added more comprehensive tests to cover edge cases such as empty contributors, invalid numeric entries, and mixed file types. The implementation was modified to accomodate these scenarios, and helper functions were added to ensure the code is maintainable. These improvements enture that the result outputted are accurate and reliable.

During our team check-in, we discussed exploring additional features outside of our current WBS. We are aiming to solidify enhancements that will make our application more appealing with real-world benefits for end users.

### Next Week:
- Finalize features to implement outside wbs and delegate tasks
- Continue working on "Chronological List of Projects" task #67
- Start "Outputting Key Information for Project" task #54

## Week 13 Personal Log

- (Nov 24 - Nov 30, 2025)<br />

<img width="1206" height="705" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c43e78-53e1-413f-9fdd-eb7efc9df79e" />

### Week Recap: 
Worked on finishing our final feature implementation which extracts target company qualities and matches them with existing user projects skills. This moves from generic job skill matching to company specific matching, capturing not only technical skills but also values and work styles. It provides a concrete bridge from mined project skills to company aligned, resume ready bullet points.

System can now:
  - Parse public company text and infer what they value (technical skills, traits, culture, work style)
  - Cross reference inferred qualities against a user's extracted project skills
  - Generate taulored resume bullet points for a specific target company
      
Skill Matching and Extraction
- Reused existing extract_job_skills as the core building block
    - Scans raw text (job ad, careers page, company description)
    - Normalizes everything for consistent matching
- Maps high level traits to phrases commonly seen in job ads.
- Implemented helpers for safer string matching (as suggested in previous pr's)
    - Avoids false triggers on partial words
    - Uses word boundaries for single word terms
- Implemented extract_softskills() for each trait/phrase to return a sorted list

Building Company Profile
- Uses user input url to fetch data from company webpage
- Implemented simple HTTP helper to fetch page contents
- Makes sure the profile is intentionally minimal but compatible with downstream ranking and bullet generation logic

Resume Bullet Point Generation
- Uses matched skills and traits from user projects and target company specific skills to generate resume-style bullet points
    - Aggregates all matched skills
- Outputs a list of tailored resume strings that can later be directly pasted into targeted resume sections

Team Meetings
- Collaborated and finished Team Contract
- Discussed and collaborated on presentation slides
- Distributed tasks for presentation 

### Next Week:
- Finalize presentation slides + present
- Final revision/refractor of code and update ReadMe for demo
- Work on Milestone #1 video demo


## Week 14 Personal Log

## T2 Week 1 Personal Log

- (Jan 5 - Jan 11, 2025)<br />

<img width="969" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a84a3419-0b93-4039-9575-55973d83fe2c" />

### Week Recap: 
Worked on creating a start up menu for the user to navigate with upon running the program. Upon granting user consent, it enters a loop with all possible program options. This makes it easier to navigate and more user/testing friendly for future implementations. Additionally, it incorporates the functions from milestone #1 and creates a centralized point for all interactions.

- Created start up menu for application
- Integrated menu options with existing program functions
- Discussed milestone #2 implementation with team
- Reviewed and tested teammate's code and pr

### Next Week:
- Complete specific integrations for all menu options so that everything can be ran through it
- Wrok on new feature for milestone #2

## T2 Week 2 Personal Log

- (Jan 12 - Jan 18, 2025)<br />

<img width="967" height="566" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42266e56-1b77-4700-aca2-324e76ea68eb" />

###Weekly Recap:
This week continued from last week's start up manu work by integrating all the underlying milestone features reliably. I focused on connecting the menu to existing modules, fixing integration issues caused by inconsistent snapshot data, and writing tests so future changes do not break basic navigation.

Coding tasks
I expanded the startup menu so each option routes to the correct functionality. I also included normalization logic to bridge differences beteween database row fields and snapshot payload keys so the menu can work across multiple stored snapshot shapes without breaking the program. 

Testing or debugging tasks
I debugged several runtime issues triggered by menu execution where functions expected dict maps but received lists. I added unittest coverage for the flow using mock data inputs and core helper calls. I also adjusted imports to avoid environment failures.

Reviewing or collaboration tasks
I helped review teammate prs for milestone 2 changes which includes success endpoints and resume textual display logic. I helped test new implementations and worked on adding additional tests which achieved better coverage for niche scenarios such as more consistent outputs even when input parameters may be missing.

###Additionally:
The primary blocked for this week was inconsistent snapshot schemas across the pipeline. This caused issues in both ranking and timeline utilities when called through the menu. I addressed this with normalization and correct data shaping prior to passing inputs to shared functions. Next week I plan to fully finalize the start menu in preparation for peer testing. I will also work on implementing milestone 2 features with the rest of the team.
